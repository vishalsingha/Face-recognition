# Face-recognition

This is a project for real-time attendence marking. In this project I've implimented face recognition by using face_recognition library and Opencv. 

## Dependency
 * numpy
 * datetime
 * open-cv
 * face_recognition
 
 
## Installation:
1. Make a verual environment: ```python -m venv face_recognition```

3. Download the repo as ```Face-recognition-main.zip``` and extract.

4. Move the faces to be detected in the ```known_images``` folder.

4. Open <strong>cmd</strong> and Navigate to the ```Face-recognition-main``` directory.

5. Install all the dependecies by running```pip install -r requirements.txt```

6. Finally run: ```python Real_time_face_detection.py```
